• Programmed a decision tree which involved entropy and gain calculation using ID3 and C4.5 algorithms.

• Implemented the model in Python, including pre-processing of data and pruning of tree to avoid overfitting 

• Extended the developed decision tree with random forest to predict the outcome with accuracy of 90%
